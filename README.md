## About the Video Course
This course supplies an overview of the Java Enterprise ecosystem by covering all the necessary APIs. A full-fledged application will be built throughout the course, thereby showcasing how to use these APIs along with other specifications. Concepts and components of Java EE such as EJB, CDI, JAX-RS, JPA, JSON-P, JSON-B, or WebSockets will equip you with all the necessary tools to understand what kinds of application can be built using this platform, along with how to go about actually building them. By the end of the course, you will be able to develop a car management enterprise application.
